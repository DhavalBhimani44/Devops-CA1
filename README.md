# Currency Converter â€” API Bug vs Fix

## ðŸ“Œ Challenge Statement
This project addresses a common **"Base Currency Assumption"** bug in currency converters.

**Reference Source:** [ExchangeRate API â€“ Pair Conversion Requests](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs/pair-conversion-requests)

**Problem:**

APIs return rates relative to a fixed base (e.g., USD or EUR). If `fromCurrency â‰  baseCurrency`, directly multiplying:
```js
converted = amount * rates[to];
